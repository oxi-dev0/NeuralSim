3 neuron types: input, internal, output

genomes code for connections between input, internal, output

inputs produce 0.0-1.0

connection weights = -4.0 to 4.0
connections multiply data by weight

internal neurons = tanh(sum(inputs)) (-1.0 to 1.0)

output neurons = tanh(sum(inputs)) (-1.0 to 1.0)
output neuron total is the probability it will fire


inputs:
slr = pheromone gradient left-right
sfd = pheromone gradient forward
sg = pheremone density
age = age
rnd = random input
blr = blockage left-right
osc = oscillator (20-30 steps)
bfd = blockage forward
plr = population gradient left-right
pop = population density in immidiate neighbourhood
pfd = population gradient forward
lpf = population long-range forward
lmy = last movement y
lbf = blockage long-range forward
lmx = last movement x
bdy = y border distance
gen = genetic similarity of fwd neighbour
bdx = x border distance
lx = x world location
bd = nearest border distance
ly = y world location

outputs:
lpd = set long-probe distance
kill = kill forward neighbour
osc = set oscillator period
sg = emit pheremone
res = set responsiveness

mfd = move forward
mrn = move random
mrv = move reverse
mrl = move left-right
mx = move x
my = move y


encoding:
1b - source type (input, internal)
7b - source id
1b - sink type (internal, output)
7b - sink id
16b - signed 16b int of weight (divided by 8000-9000 to make -4.0 to 4.0 range)
